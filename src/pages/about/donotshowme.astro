        motivation="Sharing your email with every website clutters your inbox with spam, advertisements, scams, and makes finding important messages difficult. By avoiding this, you also protect your data from being sold and linked to your other online activities."
        solution="Instead of sharing your email to access an article or any other website, simply visit donotshow.me, click 'Use Email,' paste the generated email into the website, verify using the link sent to that email, and you're done."
