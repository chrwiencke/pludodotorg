        motivation="I ended up importing all my SSH keys from GitHub using the command &quot;curl https://github.com/chrwiencke.keys >> authorized_keys&quot;, which left my authorized_keys file cluttered and unorganized."
        solution="Rather than managing all your SSH keys on GitHub in an unorganized and overwhelming way, my website offers a simple solution. Organize your keys with ease, download them individually, and use them one at a timeâ€”no need to clutter your authorized_keys file with every key. It's a fast, straightforward way to manage and utilize your SSH keys efficiently."
